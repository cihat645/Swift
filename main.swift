//write a program to store your set of tools in a collection called ToolBox. Then create a few projects that require a list of tools to complete. Develop a way of testing whether or not you can complete these projects with the tools you currently have. Print all projects you have the tools to complete and if you only need one or two more tools to complete a project, suggest you buy the required tool(s) to complete it.
